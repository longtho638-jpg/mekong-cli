**AgencyOS** is the first **AI-Native Operating System** designed for "Vibe Coding" - a new way of building software where you act as the Architect, and AI acts as the Builder.

Instead of writing every line of code, you orchestrate **Agents** to build scalable, production-ready applications using professional architectural patterns (Clean Architecture, DDD).

## The "Vibe Coding" Philosophy

Traditional coding is about syntax and logic. **Vibe Coding** is about **Vision** and **Orchestration**.

| Traditional Coding | AgencyOS (Vibe Coding) |
| :--- | :--- |
| You write the code | You **Scaffold** the blueprint |
| You debug syntax | You **Manage** the workflow |
| You maintain the structure | The **Architect Agent** enforces structure |
| Slow & Manual | **10x Faster** with AI |

## Core Components

AgencyOS provides the tools to make Vibe Coding a reality:

### 1. 🏗️ The Architect (`/scaffold`)
Don't just ask AI to "write code". Use the Architect to generate a **Professional Blueprint**.
*   Analyzes your idea (e.g., "SaaS CRM").
*   Selects the best pattern (Clean Arch, Hexagonal, or Simple).
*   Generates a precise **System Prompt** for you to feed your AI.

### 2. 📋 The Manager (`/kanban`)
Keep your AI agents focused. Use the built-in **Kanban Board** to track tasks.
*   Create tasks for specific agents (e.g., "Code Auth Module").
*   Sync status between your IDE and the Board.
*   Never lose track of context.

### 3. 🏯 The Strategist (`/binh-phap`)
Align your technology with business goals using the **Binh Pháp (Art of War)** framework.
*   Analyze market timing (Thiên).
*   Assess resources (Địa).
*   Plan your "Win Without Fighting" strategy.

## How It Works (The Flow)

1.  **Idea:** You have a concept (e.g., "Uber for Dog Walking").
2.  **Scaffold:** Run `agencyos scaffold "Uber for Dog Walking"`.
3.  **Code:** Paste the generated Blueprint into your AI Editor (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude).
4.  **Manage:** Track progress with `agencyos kanban`.
5.  **Ship:** Deploy with `agencyos ship`.
