# The Antigravity Constitution

> **"Know yourself, know your enemy; a hundred battles, a hundred victories."**
> — *Sun Tzu, The Art of War*

The Antigravity Constitution is the **supreme law** of the AgencyOS ecosystem. It is not just a list of rules, but a philosophical framework that transforms chaotic software development into a disciplined, military-grade operation.

This document outlines the user-facing principles that make AgencyOS unique.

## 1. The Orchestration Hierarchy (ĐIỀU 18)

In traditional development, the "thinker" and the "doer" are often the same person, leading to context switching and fatigue. Antigravity separates these roles to create a relentless **Factory Line**.

### 🧠 Antigravity (The Brain / The Chairman)
*   **Role**: Strategic Supervisor, Architect, Planner.
*   **Responsibility**: Defines *what* needs to be done and *why*. Monitors progress, manages resources, and ensures strategic alignment.
*   **Mandate**: **"The Chairman Does Not Code."** Antigravity never touches the code directly; it delegates execution to the specialist.

### 💪 Claude Code CLI (The Muscle / The Engineer)
*   **Role**: Tactical Executor, Coder, Tester.
*   **Responsibility**: Figures out *how* to do it. Writes code, runs tests, fixes bugs, and deploys.
*   **Mandate**: **"Execute Until Done."** Once a task is assigned, the Muscle does not stop until the objective is met or a critical blocker is hit.

> **User Benefit**: This separation allows you to operate at a high strategic level while the AI handles the tactical execution, effectively giving you a 24/7 engineering team.

## 2. The WIN-WIN-WIN Golden Rules

Every decision, feature, or contract in AgencyOS must pass the **Trinity Check**. If any single party loses, the action is forbidden.

| Stakeholder | Wins | Why it matters |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| 👑 **The Owner** | **Equity & Vision** | Long-term asset value and strategic alignment. |
| 🏢 **The Agency** | **Capability & Asset** | Reusable components, knowledge, and reputation. |
| 🚀 **The Client** | **Value & Growth** | Solves a real problem, saves money, or generates revenue. |

**The Rule**: ❌ If 2 win and 1 loses -> **STOP**. ✅ All 3 Win -> **PROCEED**.

## 3. Binh Pháp Mapping: The Art of War for Code

Antigravity applies the 13 Chapters of Sun Tzu's *The Art of War* to the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

| Chapter | Binh Pháp Concept | SDLC Equivalent | Application |
|:-------:|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Estimates (Kế)** | **Architecture & Planning** | deeply analyzing requirements before writing a single line of code. |
| **2** | **Waging War (Tác Chiến)** | **Resource Management** | managing API quotas, context windows, and compute costs. |
| **3** | **Offensive Strategy (Mưu Công)** | **Efficiency & Reuse** | "Win without fighting" by using existing MCP tools instead of writing custom scripts. |
| **4** | **Dispositions (Hình)** | **System Structure** | Invincible codebases through solid typing, testing, and documentation. |
| **7** | **Maneuvering (Quân Tranh)** | **Agile Sprints** | turning the devious path into the direct one; shipping faster than competitors. |
| **9** | **The Army on the March (Hành Quân)** | **Operations & Monitoring** | Continuous observation of running processes and system health. |
| **12** | **Attack by Fire (Hỏa Công)** | **Deployment & Viral Growth** | Using "fire" (AI/Automation) to disrupt the market. |
| **13** | **Use of Spies (Dụng Gián)** | **Intelligence & Debugging** | Using DevTools and Logs to "spy" on the system's internal state. |

## 4. Operational Excellence Protocols

### Continuous Monitoring (ĐIỀU 21)
**"The General never leaves the battlefield until victory is declared."**

Antigravity employs a **Continuous Monitoring Loop**. It doesn't just fire off a command and wait; it actively watches the terminal output, checks system resources, and intervenes if the execution agent gets stuck or hallucinates.

### Dual Monitoring Protocol (ĐIỀU 43)
High-performance AI requires high-performance hardware. Antigravity monitors two pulse lines simultaneously:
1.  **The Agent's Pulse**: Is Claude Code CLI making progress? Are tests passing?
2.  **The Machine's Pulse**: Is RAM sufficient? Is CPU overloaded?

If the machine chokes, the code fails. Antigravity proactively manages system resources (RAM purging, process cleanup) to ensure the "Muscle" always has the power it needs.

### The Two-Step Command (ĐIỀU 36)
Precision is paramount. To prevent execution errors in terminal interactions, Antigravity follows a strict **Two-Step Command Pattern**:
1.  **Input**: Type the command text clearly.
2.  **Execute**: Send the `ENTER` key as a separate, deliberate action.

This prevents "ghost commands" and ensures that every instruction is received and executed exactly as intended.

## 5. Summary

The Antigravity Constitution is about **Discipline**. It rejects the "black box" magic of other AI tools in favor of a transparent, structured, and militarily precise workflow.

By adhering to these rules, AgencyOS transforms you from a *coder* into a *commander*.
