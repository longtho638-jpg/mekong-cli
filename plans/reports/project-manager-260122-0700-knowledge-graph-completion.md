# Project Management Report: Knowledge Graph Integration Completion

**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** ✅ Phase Complete
**Version:** v2.6.0-beta
**Path:** `plans/260121-1150-knowledge-graph-integration/`

## 1. Summary of Work
Phase 13 (Knowledge Graph Integration) has been successfully completed. We have moved from ephemeral agent context to a structured, persistent long-term memory system. This allows the Agent Swarm to understand code relationships, documentation links, and business logic across different sessions and modules.

## 2. Key Features Implemented

### 🚀 Graph Infrastructure & Client
- **FalkorDB Integration**: Deployed a high-performance graph database via Docker, optimized for low-latency queries.
- **GraphClient (`antigravity/core/knowledge/graph_client.py`)**: A robust Python interface for graph operations featuring connection pooling and automatic schema management.
- **Data Models**: Pydantic-backed `KnowledgeNode` and `KnowledgeEdge` models ensure data integrity and schema enforcement.

### 📥 Ingestion & Modeling
- **Batch Ingestion (CodeIngestor)**: Automated AST parsing for the Python codebase. It maps:
  - File structures and imports.
  - Class inheritance and method signatures.
  - Dependency relationships between modules.
- **DocIngestor**: Initial support for parsing Markdown documentation into the knowledge base.

### 🛡️ Injection Protection
- **Cypher Sanitization**: Implemented strict regex-based sanitization for labels, relationship types, and properties.
- **Security Validation**: Verified against 5/5 common graph injection attack vectors.

## 3. Test Results Summary
- **Unit Tests**: `backend/tests/test_knowledge.py`
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (32/32 tests passed)
- **Coverage**: High coverage for core graph logic and ingestion utilities.
- **Performance**: Ingestion of the `mekong-cli` core took < 2 seconds in local benchmarks.

## 4. WIN-WIN-WIN Verification
- **👑 Owner WIN**: Intellectual property (IP) is now structured and searchable, increasing the value of the codebase as a "living asset."
- **🏢 AGENCY WIN**: New reusable capability (`knowledge-graph`) that can be deployed for other vertical engines.
- **🚀 STARTUP WIN**: Faster development cycles as agents have immediate access to full project context without re-reading files.

## 5. Next Steps
- **Phase 14 (RAG Implementation)**: Integrate vector embeddings for semantic "fuzzy" search within the graph.
- **UI Visualization**: Implement a Knowledge Explorer in the Dashboard to visualize agent memory.
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend AST parsing to TypeScript/JavaScript components.
