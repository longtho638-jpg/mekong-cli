# 📊 Planner Report: Integrate Antigravity Features

**ID**: a237dfe | **Date**: 2026-01-20
**Strategy**: Binh Pháp Mưu Công - Winning by Planning

## 🎯 Objective
Create a detailed implementation plan to bridge AgencyOS (mekong-cli) with Antigravity Core features, focusing on unified registries, scalable MCP infrastructure, and nuclear-grade agent orchestration.

## 🛠️ Created Plan
- **Plan Directory**: `/Users/macbookprom1/mekong-cli/plans/260120-1945-integrate-antigravity-features/`
- **Main Overview**: `plan.md`
- **Phases**:
    1. `phase-01-core-registry-unification.md`: Bridging Python/MCP registries.
    2. `phase-02-knowledge-layer-automation.md`: Scaling to 500+ rules via automation.
    3. `phase-03-mcp-layer-scaling.md`: Lazy-loading and dynamic catalog for 1500+ servers.
    4. `phase-04-agent-swarm-expansion.md`: Graph-based execution and Shared Blackboard.
    5. `phase-05-nuclear-weaponization.md`: Quota Engine centralization and Win-Win-Win gates.

## 💡 Key Strategic Decisions
- **Lazy Loading**: Essential for MCP scaling to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Unified Gateway**: Decouples the orchestrator from the source of the tool/command.
- **Rule Registry**: Shifts from static injection to semantic, context-aware rule retrieval.
- **Win-Win-Win Enforcement**: Integrated as a mandatory gate for all nuclear operations.

## 🔍 Unresolved Questions
- **Vector Search**: Should we implement a lightweight vector store for rules in Phase 2, or stick to keyword-based retrieval for the first 100 rules?
- **Shared Blackboard**: Should the Blackboard use Redis for persistence or stick to an in-memory thread-safe store for local CLI usage?
- **Quota Proxy**: Does the existing `antigravity-claude-proxy` handle all model types (Gemini, Claude, GPT) or just Gemini?
