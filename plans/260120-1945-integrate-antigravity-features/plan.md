# 📜 Integrate Antigravity Features into AgencyOS

> This plan outlines the strategic integration of Antigravity's core features into mekong-cli, focusing on unified registries, automated rule management, scalable MCP layers, and advanced agent orchestration.

## 📋 Execution Tasks
- [x] Phase 1: Core Registry Unification - Bridge Python & MCP registries.
- [x] Phase 2: Knowledge Layer Automation - Automate QUANTUM_MANIFEST and Rule Registry.
- [x] Phase 3: MCP Layer Scaling - Dynamic catalog and lazy-loading for 1500+ servers.
- [x] Phase 4: Agent Swarm Expansion - Dynamic/Graph execution and Blackboard system.
- [x] Phase 5: Nuclear Weaponization - Centralized Quota Engine and Win-Win-Win enforcement.

## 🔍 Context
Current research highlights gaps in scaling (static registries, sequential MCP connections) and orchestration (linear chains vs graph execution). The integration will leverage existing Antigravity modules (`antigravity/core/`) and package-based engines (`packages/antigravity/core/`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python (Core), TypeScript (CLI Hooks & MCP Client)
- **Frameworks**: MCP (Model Context Protocol), AgencyOS Swarm
- **Engines**: Quota Engine, ML Optimizer, Win-Win-Win Validator

## 🏯 WIN-WIN-WIN Gate
1. 👑 **Owner WIN**: Maximum efficiency, lower costs (Quota Engine), and nuclear-grade capabilities.
2. 🏢 **Agency WIN**: Scalable infrastructure to handle 1500+ tools and complex agent workflows.
3. 🚀 **Client WIN**: Faster delivery, smarter strategic insights, and robust, reliable automation.
