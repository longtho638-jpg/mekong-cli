# Plan: Landing Page Kit STARTER Product ($37)

3.  **Extraction & Refinement**: Port components, ensuring they meet standards (dark mode, a11y).
4.  **Documentation**: Write README, INSTALL, CUSTOMIZATION, and GUMROAD_LISTING.
5.  **Packaging**: Zip the product and calculate checksum.
6.  **Final Review**: Win-Win-Win validation.
