# 🏯 Antigravity Onboarding Guide (Operation Iron Man)

> **"Victory before Combat."** - Transform from No-Tech to Commander in 15 Minutes.

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the **Antigravity Onboarding Protocol**. This guide is designed to transform "civilian" setups into "nuclear command centers" capable of running the AgencyOS ecosystem at 200% efficiency.

Whether you are a solopreneur or scaling an agency, your infrastructure is your first unfair advantage.

## 🚀 Phase 1: The Engine (Hardware)

Your hardware is the brain of your operation.

### ✅ The Requirement

| Component | Minimum (Scout) | **Recommended (Warlord)** | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | **32 GB - 64 GB+** | **RAM = Context.** AI needs to hold the entire project in its "head". |
| **Chip** | M1 Pro / i7 | **M3/M4 Max / Ultra** | **Chip = Thinking Speed.** Don't let your General wait for orders. |
| **Storage** | 512 GB | **1 TB NVMe** | Speed. Loading 10,000 files should be instant. |

## 🌐 Phase 2: The Supply Line (Network)

You are downloading intelligence from the cloud. Latency is the enemy.

### ✅ The Requirement

| Component | Minimum | **Recommended** | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internet** | 100 Mbps | **1 Gbps Fiber** | **Bandwidth = Ammo Supply.** |
| **Connection** | WiFi 6 | **LAN Cable** | **Stability.** WiFi flickers. Cables do not. |
| **Route** | Standard | **International Priority** | AI servers are in the US. You need a direct line. |

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Bootloader (Software Setup)

We have automated the entire environment setup.

### 1. Download the Onboarding Kit
If you have purchased the **Antigravity Onboarding Kit**, **AgencyOS Pro**, or **Enterprise**, you have access to the 1-Click Setup Script.

### 2. Run the Script
Open your terminal and run the provided command (from your purchase email):

```bash
# Example command (requires kit)
./setup-antigravity.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Installs Homebrew, Node.js, Python 3.11+
- ✅ Configures VSCode with "God Mode" settings
- ✅ Installs `antigravity-claude-proxy` for low-latency AI
- ✅ Sets up SSH keys and Git config

## 🧠 Phase 4: The Mindset

**The "Civilian" Mindset:**
*   "I'll use my old laptop."
*   "WiFi is fine."
*   **Result:** Defeat. "AI is too hard."

**The "Warlord" Mindset (You):**
*   "I need a weapon, not a toy."
*   "Latency is the enemy."
*   **Result:** Domination. "This is easy."
