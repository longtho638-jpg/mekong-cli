## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-20

**Initial Release** - Production-ready Agency Operating System with Vietnamese-first design and Binh Pháp strategic framework.

### Architecture Refactoring

**200-Line Rule Compliance**
- All Python files refactored to under 200 lines for maintainability
- 15+ oversized files modularized into 30+ focused modules
- Zero files violate line count limits

**Infrastructure Layer**
- Modularized OpenTelemetry: tracer (599→4 files), processors (586→4 files), exporters (525→4 files)
- Refactored distributed queue scale module (317→4 files)

**Core Engines**
- Split ML models (327→5 files) and Revenue AI (314→4 files)
- Modularized 12 core engines: ab_testing, agent_orchestrator, agent_swarm, algorithm, cashflow_engine, client_magnet, code_guardian, content_factory, moat_engine, money_maker, proposal_generator, revenue

**CLI Layer**
- Split entrypoint (251 lines) into 5 command modules
- Refactored antigravity CLI (308 lines) into 5 focused modules

### Type Safety & Patterns

**Type System**
- Added `antigravity/core/types/` with TypedDict and Protocol definitions
- Replaced `Dict[str, Any]` with strongly-typed alternatives
- Reduced files using Any type from 20+ to minimal usage

**Code Reusability**
- Added `antigravity/core/mixins/` for reusable behaviors (StatsMixin)
- Added `antigravity/core/patterns/` for shared patterns (singleton_factory, BasePersistence)

### Security Hardening

**Vulnerability Fixes**
- Replaced insecure `pickle` with safe `JSON` serialization in Redis backend (RCE mitigation)
- Removed insecure default token fallback in VIBE Kanban bridge
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to exclude `.env.production`, `.env.staging`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets.json`

### Deployment Readiness

**Package Distribution**
- Production-ready `setup.py` with proper dependency management
- Entry points configured for `mekong` CLI
- Package includes templates, skills, and configuration files
- Supports both development (`pip install -e .`) and production installation

**Performance Validation**
- Verified no blocking I/O in critical async paths
- Validated configuration in `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`

### Testing & Verification

**Quality Metrics**
- 326 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- No regressions across all modules
- New test coverage for agent_swarm, algorithm_core, code_guardian

**Before/After Comparison**
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Files > 200 lines | 15+ | 0 |
| Files using Any type | 20+ | Minimal |
| New modules created | - | 30+ |
| Test pass rate | - | 100% |
| Security vulnerabilities | 2 critical | 0 |
