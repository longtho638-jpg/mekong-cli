## [2.4.0-beta] - 2026-01-21

### PayPal Migration & Backend Unification (Phase 1)
- **Environment Configuration**: Updated `.env.example`, `apps/dashboard/.env.example`, and created `backend/.env.example` with full PayPal and Supabase variable sets.
- **Production Readiness**: Hardened `vercel.json` across all apps (`dashboard`, `web`, `docs`, `mekong-docs`) with MD3-compliant security headers and optimized rewrites.
- **PayPal SDK**: Created `core/finance/paypal_sdk/subscriptions.py` to handle full subscription lifecycle (create, get, cancel, suspend/resume).
- **Unified Payment Service**: Refactored `backend/services/payment_service.py` to consolidate PayPal, Stripe, and Gumroad logic. Added subscription mapping and license generation triggers.
- **Webhook Handlers**: Consolidated webhook processing to eliminate logic duplication and ensure reliable license delivery.
- **Plan Synchronization**: Added `scripts/setup/sync_paypal_plans.py` for automated PayPal Product and Plan management.

## [2.3.0-beta] - 2026-01-21

### Testing & Quality Gates (Phase 10)
- **Frontend Testing**: Configured Jest + React Testing Library for `apps/dashboard`. Added unit tests for health cards and workflow editor.
- **E2E Infrastructure**: Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing of critical flows (Agent Creator, Workflow Builder).
- **Quality Gates**: Implemented strict `pre-push` hooks using Husky to enforce build success and test passing before pushing.
- **Backend Coverage**: Integrated Pytest with MCP handlers.

## [2.2.0-beta] - 2026-01-21

### UI/UX Expansion (Phase 9)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: New dashboard at `/dashboard/monitor` visualizing system health, quota, and anomalies.

- **Backend API**: Added new routers for `monitor`, `workflow`, and `agents-creator` to the FastAPI backend.

## [2.1.0-beta] - 2026-01-21

### Enterprise Hardening & Tech Debt
- **Security Verification**: Added `verify_security.py` to audit Privacy Hooks, Data Diet, and RBAC patterns.
- **Stress Testing**: Implemented `stress_test_swarm.py` for high-concurrency simulation of agent activity.
- **Tech Debt**: Removed 10+ stale imports referencing `packages/antigravity` across tests and legacy scripts.
- **CLI Consolidation**: Refactored `mekong_cli.py` to use modular MCP handlers directly, eliminating legacy shims.
- **Documentation**: Updated all `.claude/commands/` to use the unified `mekong` CLI and MCP tools.

## [2.0.0-beta] - 2026-01-20

### Specialization & Vertical Engines
- **Vertical Engines**: Implemented `antigravity.core.verticals` package with domain-specific logic for:
    - **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance checks, BAA generation, telehealth latency validation.
    - **Fintech**: PCI-DSS security audits, KYC tier validation, transaction idempotency checks.
    - **SaaS**: Multi-tenancy provisioning, subscription proration, churn risk assessment.
- **Auditor**: Added `VerticalAuditor` for centralized compliance and security auditing across all verticals.
- **Integration**: Updated `AgencyHandler` and `CommandRouter` to support specialized `/audit` and `/onboard` workflows.

### CI/CD & Reliability
- **CLI Verification**: Updated GitHub Actions to install the `mekong-cli` package and verify the `mekong` entry point.
- **Test Stability**: Fixed 10+ import issues and missing rule references to achieve a 100% test pass rate (328/328).
- **Rule Registry**: Enhanced `RuleRegistry` to recursively scan directories, supporting complex rule hierarchies.

### Versioning & Polish
- **Version Sync**: Synchronized `antigravity/__init__.py` and `setup.py` to v0.2.0 (Stable Base) with beta features on top.
