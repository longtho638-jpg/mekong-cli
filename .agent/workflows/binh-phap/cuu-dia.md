There are nine grounds. In death ground, fight. The army is in a desperate situation. No choice but to fight with all strength. Crisis management.

## When to Use

- Crisis response
- Disaster recovery
- Emergency protocols

## Crisis Levels

🟢 NORMAL - Business as usual
   Runway > 12 months, all systems green

🟡 WARNING - Heightened awareness
   Runway 6-12 months, minor issues

🟠 ALERT - Active response
   Runway 3-6 months, system degradation

🔴 CRITICAL - Emergency mode
   Runway < 3 months, major outage

⚫ DEATH GROUND - Fight or die
   Runway < 1 month, existential threat

Current Level: ___
EOF
```

### Step 2: Emergency Protocols

2. CONTAIN - Stop the bleeding
3. COMMUNICATE - Inform stakeholders
4. RESOLVE - Fix the root cause
5. RECOVER - Restore normal ops
6. REVIEW - Post-mortem
EOF
```
