## ✉️ Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold Email
**Subject**: How {company} could save 10+ hours/week

```
Hi {first_name},

I found {company} while researching agencies in {location} - love what you're building.

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on:
- Manual client reporting?
- Chasing invoices?
- Switching between 10 different tools?

We built Agency OS specifically for solo operators and small teams facing these challenges.

One command generates reports. One command creates invoices. All from your terminal.

Worth a 15-minute chat? I'll show you exactly how it works.

Best,
{your_name}

P.S. Not a fit? Just reply "no thanks" and I'll never email you again.
```

### Template 2: Follow-up (Day 3)
**Subject**: Re: How {company} could save 10+ hours/week

```
Hi {first_name},

Just floating this back up - know you're busy.

One client told us they saved 15 hours/week after switching to Agency OS.

That's almost 2 full work days reclaimed.

15 minutes to see if it could work for you?

### Template 3: Breakup Email (Day 7)
**Subject**: Should I close your file?

```
Hi {first_name},

I've reached out a couple times about Agency OS but haven't heard back.

No worries if it's not the right time - I'll assume you're not interested 
and won't reach out again.

But if you DO want to see how to run a more efficient agency, 
here's the link: [Demo Link]

Either way, wishing you success!

## 🏆 Closing Tactics

### Handle Objections

**"Too expensive"**
> "I understand. Let me ask - how much time do you spend on reporting each week? 
> At your hourly rate, that's probably $X/month. Agency OS saves you that and more."

**"I'm too small"**
> "That's exactly who we built this for. 1 person should be able to run like a 10-person agency."

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Totally fair. What specifically would you want to think through? 
> Maybe I can help answer some questions now."

**"I use other tools already"**
> "Which ones? [Listen] Got it. Most of our users came from similar setups. 
> The difference is having everything in one place, with AI doing the heavy lifting."

### Create Urgency (Ethical)
- "Founding member pricing ends this month"
- "I have 2 demo slots left this week"
- "Early users get direct Slack access to founders"
