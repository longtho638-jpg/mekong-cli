Headline: Your Agency Just Got an Enterprise Upgrade: AgencyOS v5.0.0 is Here! 🚀

Running an agency is hard. Scaling one is even harder.

Most agencies get stuck because their operations are fragmented. Billing is manual, data is scattered, and "production ready" is just a dream.

Today, we change that. We are thrilled to announce AgencyOS v5.0.0—our most significant release to date, built to turn your agency into a high-performance revenue engine.

What’s under the hood?

✅ Production-Grade Stability: We’ve hardened the infrastructure with CI/CD pre-deploy checks and enterprise security headers. This is built for scale.

✅ Universal Payments: A unified billing engine for Stripe, PayPal, and SePay. Automate your subscriptions, handle downgrades/upgrades seamlessly, and get paid faster.

✅ Revenue Intelligence: A true Mission Control dashboard. Track your MRR, ARR, and Churn in real-time. Stop managing from spreadsheets and start leading with data.

✅ Professionalized Onboarding: A new 5-step wizard to get your workspace running in minutes, not days.

This isn’t just a version update; it’s a professionalization milestone. Whether you’re a boutique shop or a growing powerhouse, v5.0.0 gives you the tools to automate the boring stuff so you can focus on winning.
