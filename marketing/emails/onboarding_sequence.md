Hi {first_name},

Did you know AgencyOS is built on the principles of **Binh Pháp** (The Art of War)?

*“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”*

In agency terms, this means positioning yourself so strongly that clients choose you before you even pitch.

### 💎 Feature Spotlight: Binh Pháp Strategy Dashboard

Use the `/binh-phap` command or visit the Strategy tab to:
- Analyze your competitive landscape (Thiên/Địa).
- Identify your unique "Moat" (Hào lũy).
- Generate a 13-chapter growth plan tailored to your niche.

Don't just run an agency. Command a market.
