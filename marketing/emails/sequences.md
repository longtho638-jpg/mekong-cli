### Email 3: Binh Pháp Intro (Day 3)
**Subject**: ⚔️ The ancient strategy that modern agencies swear by

**Body**:
```
Hi {first_name},

Did you know Agency OS is built on Binh Pháp - the Art of War?

Here's why that matters:

"Bất chiến nhi khuất nhân chi binh"
(Win without fighting - the highest excellence)

In agency terms: **Position yourself so clients come to you.**

The Binh Pháp dashboard (/binhphap) gives you:
- Competitive positioning tools
- Strategic planning frameworks
- Win-rate optimization

Most agencies compete on price. You can compete on positioning.

Check it out: [Explore Binh Pháp]

Strategically yours,
Agency OS Team
