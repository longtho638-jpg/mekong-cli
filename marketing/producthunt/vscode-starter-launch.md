## First Comment

Hi ProductHunt! 👋

I'm BillMentor, a solo founder who's built 10+ products using this exact VSCode setup.

I got tired of spending hours configuring VSCode for each new project. So I packaged my entire setup into one downloadable pack.

What makes it special:

- **Settings**: Optimized for speed (no more lag)
- **Extensions**: Only the essentials (no bloat)
- **Snippets**: Real-world patterns I use daily

It's 100% free. No catch.

Would love your feedback! 🙏
