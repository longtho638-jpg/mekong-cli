## 💼 LinkedIn Post (Professional/Scale Focus)

**Headline**: Why we spent 48 hours mapping our Sales Assets to our Codebase (Binh Pháp Strategy) 🏯

Most templates are just files. Ours are **Strategic Weapons**.

We just pushed the "10x Deep Review" update to the entire AgencyOS product suite. The goal? To ensure that every dollar you spend on a starter kit translates directly to a "Technical Moat" in your architecture.

✅ **VIBE Starter** -> Mapped to `/commands` (Speed)
✅ **AI Skills** -> Mapped to `/skills` (Intelligence)
✅ **AgencyOS Pro** -> Mapped to `/memory` (Context)

We call this "Architecture-Native" Productization.

It's not enough to write code. You must build an **Empire**.
The update is live for all existing customers (Lifetime Updates).

**Body**:

Chào anh/em [Name],

We just completed a massive "Deep 10x Review" of the entire AgencyOS ecosystem.

If you own any of our Starter Kits, **you just got a free upgrade.**

We've re-engineered the products to align perfectly with the modern `.claude` Agent Architecture:

1.  **VIBE Starter**: Now centered on "Commanding" (Điều binh) rather than just coding.
2.  **AI Skills**: Positioning Claude as your "Quân Sư" (Strategic Advisor).
3.  **AgencyOS Pro**: The "Central Brain" for multi-team ops.

**Why this matters:**
This ensures that the tools you use don't just "work"—they **build value** into your agency's IP from Day 1.
