# Python Docstring Standards

Guidelines for documenting Python code using docstrings.

## Rules
- Use triple double quotes `"""Docstring contents"""`.
- Follow the Google Style or NumPy style for docstrings.
- Include a one-line summary followed by a detailed description if necessary.
- Document arguments (`Args`), return values (`Returns`), and exceptions (`Raises`).
- Keep docstrings up-to-date as the code changes.
- Use docstrings for modules, classes, and public functions/methods.
