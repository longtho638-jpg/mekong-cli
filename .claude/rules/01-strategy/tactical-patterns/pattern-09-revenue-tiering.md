# Tactical Pattern 09: Revenue Tiering

> **Value Extraction**

## Context
Pricing services or negotiating contracts.

## Pattern
1. **Assess**: Which stage is the startup? (Seed, Series A, Venture Studio).
2. **Select**: Apply the corresponding tier rules (Warrior, General, Tướng Quân).
3. **Offer**: Present the package (Retainer + Equity + Success Fee).
4. **Enforce**: Don't deviate from the standard without a Win3 check.

## Goal
Standardized, fair, and scalable revenue.
