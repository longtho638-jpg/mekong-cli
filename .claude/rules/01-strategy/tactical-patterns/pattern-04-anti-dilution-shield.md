# Tactical Pattern 04: The Anti-Dilution Shield

> **Funding Protection**

## Context
Use when a startup client receives a Term Sheet.

## Pattern
1. **Scan**: Look for Liquidation Pref > 1x, Full Ratchet, Board control flip.
2. **Flag**: Highlight dangerous terms immediately.
3. **Counter**: Propose standard terms (Weighted Average, Founder Control).
4. **Agent**: Deploy `vc-hub` to compare with market standards.

## Goal
Preserve founder ownership and agency equity value.
