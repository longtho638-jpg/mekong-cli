# Tactical Pattern 02: Nuclear Conversion

> **Input -> Nuclear Weapon Output**

## Context
Use when implementing any feature requested by the user.

## Pattern
1. **Input**: User gives a simple request (e.g., "Add a form").
2. **Enhance**: Apply `nuclear-weaponization` rule.
   - Can we automate it?
   - Can we make it simpler?
   - Can we integrate it with existing systems?
   - Can we make it $0 cost?
3. **Output**: Delivered feature is robust, integrated, and "weaponized" (high leverage).

## Example
User: "I need a script to email leads."
Agent: Creates `client-magnet` module with automated qualification, CRM sync, and usage quotas.
