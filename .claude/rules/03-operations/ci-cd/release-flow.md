# Release Flow Standards

Guidelines for releasing new versions of the software.

## Rules
- Use a branching strategy like GitFlow or GitHub Flow.
- All releases must be tagged in Git using Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
- Automated release notes generation based on commit messages.
- Production releases must be triggered by a manual approval or a specific tag.
- Maintain a clear changelog that is updated automatically during the release process.
- Perform a "dry run" or deployment to staging before any production release.
- Ensure all stakeholders are notified of upcoming and completed releases.
