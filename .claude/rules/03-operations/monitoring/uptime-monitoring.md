# Uptime Monitoring Standards

Guidelines for ensuring high availability and uptime.

## Rules
- Implement external "heartbeat" or "synthetic" monitoring to check service availability.
- Monitor from multiple geographic locations to detect regional issues.
- Set up status pages to communicate uptime and incident status to users.
- Configure alerts for service downtime or significant degradation in availability.
- Define and monitor Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for uptime (e.g., 99.9%).
- Perform regular failover and disaster recovery drills.
- Analyze the root cause of every downtime incident.
