# Alerting Standards

Guidelines for effective incident notification.

## Rules
- Alerts must be actionable; if no action is required, it should be a notification or a log.
- Define clear escalation paths for different alert severities.
- Minimize alert fatigue by tuning thresholds and grouping related alerts.
- Every alert should link to a relevant dashboard and runbook for resolution.
- Use multiple notification channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, Email) based on urgency.
- Conduct "on-call" rotations and ensure responders have the necessary access and knowledge.
- Review alert frequency and accuracy monthly to reduce false positives.
