# Access Provisioning Rules

> **"Không để cửa ngỏ"** - Secure and streamlined access.

## 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant only necessary permissions.
- Use temporary credentials where possible.
- Rotate keys immediately after offboarding.

## 2. Tooling
- **1Password**: Use shared vaults for credentials.
- **GitHub**: Use teams for repository access.
- **Cloud**: Use IAM roles, not root accounts.

## 3. Checklist
- [ ] Source Code (GitHub/GitLab)
- [ ] Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure)

- [ ] Communication (Slack/Discord)
- [ ] Documentation (Notion/Confluence)
