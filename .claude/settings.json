Use kebab-case for file names with a meaningful name that describes the purpose of the file, doesn't matter if the file name is long, make sure when LLMs read the file names while using `Grep` or other tools, they can understand the purpose of the file without reading the file content. Automatically decide what to do next and continue with the best strategy."
