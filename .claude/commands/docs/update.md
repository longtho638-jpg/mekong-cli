## Phase 1: Parallel Codebase Scouting

1. Scan the codebase and calculate the number of files with LOC in each directory (skip credentials, cache or external modules directories, such as `.claude`, `.opencode`, `.git`, `tests`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `secrets`, etc.)
2. Target directories **that actually exist** - adapt to project structure, don't hardcode paths
3. Main agent spawns multiple `scout` subagents via Task tool:
   - Write a detailed instructions prompt for each scout subagent with exact directories or files it should read
   - Each scout subagent has less than 200K tokens of context window
   - Amount of scouts depends on the current system resources available and project size in step 1
   - Each scout subagent must return a detailed summary report to a main agent
5. Main agent merges scout reports into context summary and delegate to `docs-manager` agent to update documentation (next phase)

## Phase 2: Documentation Update (docs-manager Agent)

Pass the gathered file list to `docs-manager` agent to update documentation:
- `README.md`: Update README (keep it under 300 lines)
- `docs/project-overview-pdr.md`: Update project overview and PDR (Product Development Requirements)
- `docs/codebase-summary.md`: Update codebase summary
- `docs/code-standards.md`: Update codebase structure and code standards
- `docs/system-architecture.md`: Update system architecture
- `docs/project-roadmap.md`: Update project roadmap
- `docs/deployment-guide.md` [optional]: Update deployment guide
- `docs/design-guidelines.md` [optional]: Update design guidelines

## Important
- Use `docs/` directory as the source of truth for documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: **Do not** start implementing.
