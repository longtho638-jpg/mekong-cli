# WIN-WIN-WIN Alignment Workflow

## Purpose

Ensure all stakeholders benefit from every decision.

## Stakeholders

| Party | Wins Through |
|-------|--------------|
| 👑 **ANH** | Portfolio equity + cash flow + legacy |
| 🏢 **AGENCY** | Deal flow + knowledge + infrastructure |
| 🚀 **STARTUP** | Protection + strategy + network |

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Identify Parties
Who are the stakeholders in this decision?

### Step 2: Define Wins
What does each party gain?

### Step 3: Check Alignment
Are all wins mutually compatible?

### Step 4: Identify Losses
Is any party losing? If yes → STOP

### Step 5: Proceed or Adjust
- All WIN → Proceed
- Any LOSE → Adjust or walk away

## Anti-Patterns

**NEVER do:**
- ❌ Bill hours without outcomes
- ❌ Take equity without adding value
- ❌ Advise without execution support
- ❌ One-sided wins (agency only)

**ALWAYS do:**
- ✅ Tie fees to outcomes
- ✅ Align equity with startup success
- ✅ Provide anti-dilution protection
- ✅ Share exit celebration

## Daily Check

Before ending each day:
```
□ Hôm nay Anh WIN gì?
□ Hôm nay Agency WIN gì?
□ Hôm nay Startup WIN gì?
□ Không có ai LOSE?
```
