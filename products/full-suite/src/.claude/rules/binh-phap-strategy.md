# Binh Pháp Strategy Rule

> **"Thượng binh phạt mưu"** - The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.

## WIN-WIN-WIN Validation (MANDATORY)

Before EVERY business decision, strategic recommendation, or deal evaluation, you MUST validate:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  👑 ANH (Owner) WIN gì?                           │
│  🏢 AGENCY WIN gì?                                │
│  🚀 STARTUP/CLIENT WIN gì?                        │
│                                                   │
│  ❌ Nếu bất kỳ bên nào LOSE → DỪNG LẠI           │
│  ✅ Cả 3 WIN → Tiến hành                          │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
