```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  👑 ANH (Owner) WIN gì?                       │
│  🏢 AGENCY WIN gì?                            │
│  🚀 STARTUP/CLIENT WIN gì?                    │
│                                               │
│  ❌ Nếu bất kỳ bên nào LOSE → DỪNG LẠI       │
│  ✅ Cả 3 WIN → Tiến hành                      │
