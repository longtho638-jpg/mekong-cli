```markdown
Stop wasting hours debugging multipart uploads, S3 permissions, and image optimization.

The File Upload Kit is a production-ready, drop-in solution for handling file uploads in Next.js applications. Whether you're building a SaaS, a media platform, or an internal tool, this kit has everything you need to handle files securely and efficiently.

THE PROBLEM
Handling file uploads correctly is hard:
- Server Timeouts: Uploading large files to serverless functions often fails
- Complex S3 Setup: Configuring CORS, IAM, and policies is a headache
- Poor UX: Users hate staring at a spinning loader without progress bars
- Slow Images: Serving unoptimized images kills your PageSpeed score

THE SOLUTION
We've solved all the hard parts for you.

WHAT YOU GET
✅ Multi-Cloud Support: Works seamlessly with AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2
✅ Multipart Uploads: Robust support for large files (>100MB) with chunking, parallelism, and retries
✅ Direct-to-Cloud: Uses presigned URLs to upload directly from browser to storage, bypassing server limits
✅ Image Optimization: Automatically resize, compress, and convert images to WebP on the fly
✅ Real-Time Progress: Beautiful UI with accurate progress bars, upload speed, and ETA
✅ Drag & Drop: Modern, responsive drag-and-drop zone built with React Dropzone
✅ Secure: Proper validation, type checking, and security best practices included

WHAT'S INSIDE
• Complete Source Code: Full TypeScript source for hooks, components, and API routes
• React Components: FileUploader, FileDropzone, FileList ready to style with Tailwind CSS
• Custom Hooks: useFileUpload and usePresignedUrl for easy integration
• Backend Logic: API routes for multipart orchestration and image processing using sharp
• Documentation: Step-by-step guides for AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2 setup

WHY $47?
A senior engineer takes ~25 hours to build a robust file upload system.
25 hours x $50/hr = $1,250 value.
