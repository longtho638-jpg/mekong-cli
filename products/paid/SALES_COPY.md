## 🚀 Why This Template?

### 1. Save 60+ Hours of Development
We've built the boring stuff so you don't have to. User management, RBAC, settings, audit logs—it's all done. Focus on your unique features.

### 2. Enterprise-Ready Architecture
This isn't a "toy" template. It uses **TanStack Query** for data fetching, **Zustand** for state, and a robust **Role-Based Access Control** system used by Fortune 500 companies.

### 3. No Vendor Lock-In
We use headless libraries like **TanStack Table** instead of expensive proprietary grids. You own the code. No ongoing license fees.
