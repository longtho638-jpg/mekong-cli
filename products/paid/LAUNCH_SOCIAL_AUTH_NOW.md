```markdown
Stop Wasting Hours on OAuth. Add Social Login to Your SaaS in Minutes.

Secure, production-ready authentication for FastAPI & React. Supports Google, GitHub, and Discord out of the box.

THE PROBLEM
You're building a SaaS. You just want users to sign in. But suddenly you're reading OAuth2 RFCs, debugging redirect loops, fighting with JWT signatures, and worrying about token rotation security.

Every hour you spend on auth is an hour NOT spent on your core product.

THE SOLUTION
Social Auth Kit is a "drop-in" authentication microservice. Production-grade code that handles the hard parts for you.

WHAT YOU GET
✅ Backend Core: Robust FastAPI service with Async SQLAlchemy
✅ 3 Providers: Google, GitHub, Discord pre-configured
✅ Enterprise Security:
   • Short-lived JWT Access Tokens (15 min)
   • Database-backed Refresh Tokens (7 days)
   • Automatic Token Rotation (Replay attack protection)
   • HttpOnly Cookies (XSS protection)
   • CSRF state validation (CVSS 8.1 vulnerability FIXED)
✅ Frontend Integration: React Hooks (useAuth) and styled components
✅ Unified Profile: One standard user schema, no matter the provider
✅ Docker Ready: docker-compose up and you're running

WHY $27?
A senior engineer takes ~20 hours to build this securely from scratch.
20 hours x $50/hr = $1,000 value.
Get it today for $27.

WHO IS THIS FOR?
• Solo Founders: Launch faster
• Agencies: Stop rewriting auth for every client
• Python Devs: Best practices for FastAPI auth in one repo

100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE
If you can't get it running in 15 minutes, I'll refund you immediately.
