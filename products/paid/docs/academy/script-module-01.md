## [0:00 - 0:45] The Problem (The Soldier's Trap)

**(Visual: A tired person staring at a screen full of red error messages. Late night.)**

**Narrator (Deep Voice):**
"You bought the courses. You watched the tutorials. You tried to learn Python, JavaScript, React. And you failed."

"You stopped because it felt like trying to learn a new language while building a house... brick... by... brick."

**(Visual: Camera zooms into the code. It looks alien.)**

"You failed because you were trying to be a **Soldier**."

"A soldier takes orders. A soldier digs trenches. A soldier worries about syntax, semicolons, and missing brackets. It is a noble job. But it is not *your* job."

---

## [0:45 - 1:30] The Shift (The General's Mindset)

**(Visual: Scene shifts. A War Room. A General looking at a holographic map. Clean, high-tech.)**

"You are a **General**. Your job is Strategy. Your job is Vision. Your job is to define the *Objective*."

"Imagine if Napoleon stopped a battle to sew a button on a soldier's uniform. He would lose the war. That is what you do when you try to debug code."

"To win, you must stop digging trenches. You must start issuing orders."

## [1:30 - 2:30] The Weapon (Antigravity & AI)

**(Visual: The Antigravity Terminal. The user types "cc build a crm". Text streams green. A full app appears.)**

"This... is your Army. The Antigravity IDE. It is not just a code editor. It is a legion of expert soldiers—Planners, Coders, Testers—waiting for your command."

"They don't sleep. They don't complain. And they know every programming language in existence."

"They don't need you to teach them *how* to code. They need you to tell them *what* to build."

---

## [2:30 - 3:30] The Infrastructure (The Suit)

**(Visual: Iron Man putting on the suit. Then cut to a shot of a 64GB RAM Mac Studio and a LAN cable.)**

"But a General cannot command from a cave with a broken radio."

"That is why we demand the hardware. The RAM. The Fiber Internet. The Proxy."

"It is not 'tech specs'. It is your Command Center. When you have the right infrastructure, your orders reach the legion instantly. No lag. No hesitation."

"You are building a nuclear silo, not a home office."

---

## [3:30 - 4:30] The Mission

**(Visual: The General looks at the camera.)**

"From this moment on, you are forbidden from writing code manually."

"If you see an error, you do not fix it. You copy it, paste it to your Lieutenant (Claude), and say: 'Fix this'."

"You are here to build Empires, not to write scripts. Welcome to the Academy."

---

## [4:30 - 5:00] Outro

**(Visual: Antigravity Logo pulsing.)**

"Next Module: The Radio. How to talk to your legion without fear."
