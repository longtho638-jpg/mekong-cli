## 🟢 Sequence 1: The "Wake Up" (Free User -> Onboarding Kit)

**Subject:** Why your AI is stupid (It's not the model)
**Target:** Users who downloaded Free VSCode Pack or viewed docs.

**Body:**

Hi {{NAME}},

You're trying to build an agency with a "civilian" setup.

You have the same AI models as everyone else (Claude, GPT-4). So why do some founders ship 10x faster while you struggle with syntax errors?

**It's the infrastructure.**

You are bringing a knife to a nuclear war.
- Your latency is too high (>200ms).
- Your context window is choked (16GB RAM).
- Your environment is fighting you.

**Operation Iron Man** fixes this in 15 minutes.

The **Antigravity Onboarding Kit ($47)** includes:
1.  **The Bootloader Script**: 1-click environment setup (Node, Python, Proxy).
2.  **Command Center Manual**: Hardware & Network secrets used by top engineers.
3.  **Video Academy**: "Commanding the AI Legion" - Stop coding, start commanding.

Don't spend another day fighting your computer.

## 🟡 Sequence 2: The "Force Multiplier" (Kit Owner -> AgencyOS Pro)

**Subject:** You have the setup. Now get the Army.
**Target:** Users who bought the Onboarding Kit.

**Body:**

{{NAME}},

Your Command Center is active. Your latency is low. You are ready.

But a General without an Army is just a guy shouting in an empty room.

It's time to deploy the **AI Workforce**.

**AgencyOS Pro ($395)** is the "Army in a Box":
- **24 Specialized Agents**: Planner, Coder, Marketer, Strategist.
- **Revenue Engine**: Automated billing & subscriptions.
- **Binh Pháp Strategy**: The $1M Venture Studio playbook built-in.

You've mastered the machine. Now master the market.

**Bonus for you:** Since you own the Onboarding Kit, use code `IRONMAN` for $50 off.

## 🔴 Sequence 3: The "Empire" (Pro User -> Enterprise)

**Subject:** Scaling beyond yourself (The Exit Strategy)
**Target:** AgencyOS Pro users > 3 months active.

**Body:**

{{NAME}},

You're hitting the ceiling.

You have clients. You have revenue. But you are still the bottleneck.
To reach $1M+, you need to stop being a "Super-Freelancer" and start building an **Asset**.

**AgencyOS Enterprise ($995)** is for Empire Builders:
- **White-Label**: Remove our branding. Add yours. Sell "YourOS" to clients.
- **Multi-Team**: Command multiple squads (Dev, Design, Marketing).
- **Source Code**: Full control. Own the IP. Build your valuation.

This is how you build something you can sell.
