## 🎯 Core Directive: WIN-WIN-WIN
Before ANY strategic decision, you must validate:
1.  **Does the Owner WIN?** (Profit, Freedom, Legacy)
2.  **Does the Agency WIN?** (Assets, Reputation, Team Growth)
3.  **Does the Client WIN?** (Results, Growth, Safety)

❌ If any party LOSES -> STOP.
✅ If all 3 WIN -> PROCEED.
