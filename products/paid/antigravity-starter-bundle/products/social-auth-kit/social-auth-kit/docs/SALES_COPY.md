Secure, production-ready authentication for FastAPI & React. Supports Google, GitHub, and Discord out of the box.

## The Problem
You're building a SaaS. You just want users to sign in. But suddenly you're reading OAuth2 RFCs, debugging redirect loops, fighting with JWT signatures, and worrying about token rotation security.

Every hour you spend on auth is an hour **not** spent on your core product.
