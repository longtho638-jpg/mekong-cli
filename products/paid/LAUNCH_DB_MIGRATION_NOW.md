Stop Wrestling With Complex ORM Migrations. Take Control of Your Database Schema.

Database migrations shouldn't be a battle. Yet most developers spend hours fighting with complex ORM tools, debugging failed migrations, or manually writing rollback scripts that might not work when you need them most.

THE PROBLEM
You're building a Python app with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite. But suddenly you're:
- Debugging cryptic ORM migration errors
- Writing manual rollback scripts for production emergencies
- Managing complex migration dependencies across environments
- Dealing with framework lock-in (can't switch ORMs easily)
- Missing features like auto-schema-diff and seed management

Every hour on migration hell is an hour NOT spent on your core product.

THE SOLUTION
Database Migration Kit is a lightweight, production-ready CLI tool that gives you full control over database changes without the bloat of heavy frameworks. Write raw SQL or use SQLAlchemy—your choice.

WHAT YOU GET
✅ Universal Database Support: Works seamlessly with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite
✅ Atomic Rollbacks: Sleep easy knowing you can undo changes safely with transactions
✅ Zero Framework Lock-in: Write raw SQL or use any ORM—no vendor lock-in
✅ Developer-Friendly CLI: Intuitive `dmk` command that just works
✅ Production Features:
   • Transaction support for safe migrations
   • Seed management for dev/staging data
   • Full migration history tracking
   • Schema diff engine (auto-generate migrations)
   • Status monitoring across environments
✅ Diff Engine: Auto-generate migrations by comparing code to database
✅ Seeder System: Manage development and staging data easily
✅ Comprehensive Docs: Installation, migration, and rollback guides
✅ 100% Python: Easy to extend and integrate into existing workflows

WHY $47?
A senior engineer takes ~25 hours to build a robust migration system.
25 hours x $50/hr = $1,250 value.

After rolling back a failed production migration at 3am for the 5th time, I realized database schema management is harder than it should be:

Heavy ORMs. Complex dependencies. Missing rollback support. Framework lock-in.

I built Database Migration Kit—a lightweight CLI that gives you full control:

• Universal database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
• Atomic transactions (safe rollbacks)
• Schema diff engine (auto-generate migrations)
• Seed management (dev/staging data)
• Zero ORM lock-in (write raw SQL or use any framework)
