# Build Production-Ready AI Chatbots in Hours, Not Weeks

**The Ultimate AI Chatbot Starter Kit for Developers**

Are you tired of spending 40+ hours setting up the same boilerplate for every AI project? wrestling with LangChain documentation, debugging streaming responses, and trying to figure out how to persistently store chat history?

You're not alone. The AI gold rush is here, but the complexity barrier is high.

**Stop Reinventing the Wheel.**

The **Antigravity AI Chatbot Starter Kit** is a complete, production-ready foundation designed to get you from "zero" to "shipped" in a single afternoon.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### 1. Robust FastAPI Backend
A scalable Python backend pre-configured with the industry's best tools:
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Switch between OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude 3), and Google (Gemini) with one line of config.
- **Built-in RAG Pipeline**: Upload documents (TXT, MD) and instantly chat with them. No complex vector DB setup required—it works out of the box with ChromaDB.
- **Memory Management**: Persistent conversation history using Redis and PostgreSQL. Your bot remembers context!
- **Streaming Responses**: Native Server-Sent Events (SSE) support for that buttery-smooth "ChatGPT-like" typing effect.

### 2. Modern React Frontend
A beautiful, responsive Chat UI built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Hooks and utilities pre-wired to handle SSE streams effortlessly.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Code blocks, tables, and lists render perfectly.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Looks great on phone and desktop.

### 3. Developer Experience First
- **Docker Compose**: One command (`docker-compose up`) to spin up the entire stack (Backend + Frontend + DBs).
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic models (Backend) and TypeScript interfaces (Frontend).
- **3 Example Templates**:
    1.  **Simple Q&A Bot**: For support/FAQs.
    2.  **RAG Assistant**: "Chat with your Data".
    3.  **Conversational Agent**: Multi-turn persona bot.
