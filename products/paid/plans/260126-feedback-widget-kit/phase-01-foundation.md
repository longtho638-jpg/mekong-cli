# Phase 1: Foundation

**Status**: Complete
**Goal**: Set up the project structure and development environment.

## Steps
1. Create directory structure:
   ```
   feedback-widget-kit/
   ├── widget/ (React Library)
   ├── backend/ (FastAPI)
   ├── dashboard/ (React Admin)
   └── docker-compose.yml
   ```
2. Initialize `backend` with FastAPI, Poetry, and Docker.
3. Initialize `widget` with Vite (Library mode) or just source files.
4. Initialize `dashboard` with Vite (React + Tailwind).

## Deliverables
- Working Docker Compose.
- "Hello World" from Backend.
- Empty React projects.
