# Phase 1: The Blueprint

## 1. Overview
We have created the "Antigravity Setup Guide", rebranded as **"The Command Center Manual"**. This document is non-technical, using military/strategy metaphors to explain why 64GB RAM and Fiber Internet are "weapons" not "specs".

## 2. Key Insights (from Brainstorm)
- **Metaphor:** RAM = Context (Intelligence capacity). CPU = Thinking Speed. Fiber = Supply Line.
- **Interactive:** Use checklists.
- **Goal:** "Green Light" status before they even open the terminal.

## 3. Deliverables
- `docs/onboarding/01-command-center-manual.md` containing:
    - **The Engine (Hardware):** RAM/Chip requirements with "Why" explained simply.
    - **The Supply Line (Network):** FTTH + LAN setup.
    - **The Tunnel (Proxy):** Introduction to Antigravity Proxy.
    - **The Checklist:** Interactive "Ready for Battle" check.

## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  ✅ Create directory `products/paid/docs/onboarding/`.
2.  ✅ Draft `01-command-center-manual.md` with the "Iron Man" tone.
3.  ✅ Include a "Speed Test Protocol" section (How to measure latency to US West).
4.  ✅ Include a "Hardware Shopping List" for Vietnam context (Mac Studio/Mini vs PC).

## 5. Success Criteria
- ✅ A user reading this can order the exact hardware and internet package needed without asking "What is RAM?".
- ✅ Clear distinction between "Civilian Setup" (WiFi, 8GB RAM) and "Warlord Setup" (LAN, 64GB RAM).
