# Phase 3: The Academy

## 1. Overview
Teaching NO-TECH users to code is a failure. We must teach them to **Command**. This phase defines the curriculum for the "Academy" - focusing on strategy, prompt engineering, and agent orchestration.

## 2. Curriculum Structure
- **Module 1: The Mindset (Thủy Kế)**
    - You are the General, not the Soldier.
    - The Trinity of Winning (Owner, Agency, Client).
- **Module 2: The Radio (The Terminal)**
    - `cc` = Call Claude.
    - `agencyos` = Your Operating System.
    - How to read the "Matrix" (Terminal output) without fear.
- **Module 3: The Orders (Prompting)**
    - Bad Order: "Make it work."
    - Good Order: "Context + Goal + Constraints."
    - The "Vibe" of a prompt.
- **Module 4: The Maneuver (Workflow)**
    - Plan -> Scaffold -> Cook -> Ship.
    - Using `kanban` to track agents.

## 3. Deliverables
- `products/paid/docs/academy/curriculum-outline.md`
- `products/paid/docs/academy/script-module-01.md` (Sample script for the first video).

## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  ✅ Draft the full curriculum outline.
2.  ✅ Write the detailed script for Module 1 to set the tone (Military/Strategic).
3.  ✅ Define the "200% Challenge" practice exercise for students.

## 5. Success Criteria
- ✅ A user finishing the course understands *how* to use the tool without knowing *how* the tool works internally.
- ✅ Shift from "I don't know Python" to "I know how to deploy a Python app using Agent Coder".
