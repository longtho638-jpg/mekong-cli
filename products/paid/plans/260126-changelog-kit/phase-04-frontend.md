# Phase 4: Frontend Implementation

**Status**: In Progress
**Goal**: Build the React components for the full page view and the embeddable widget.

## Steps

1. **API Client (`src/lib/api.ts`)**
   - Fetch changelog data from the backend.

2. **Components**
   - `ChangelogPage.tsx`: A timeline view of all updates.
   - `ChangelogWidget.tsx`: A bell icon that opens a popover.

3. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Ensure it looks good in both light and dark modes (if possible, or just clean neutral).

4. **Integration in `App.tsx`**
   - Show both components for testing.

## Deliverables
- Functional Page and Widget in the preview app.
