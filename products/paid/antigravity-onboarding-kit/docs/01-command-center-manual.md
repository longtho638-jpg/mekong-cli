# 🏯 The Command Center Manual (Antigravity Setup Guide)

> This is not a technical manual. This is a **Strategic Deployment Guide**.
> You are not "setting up a computer". You are building a **Nuclear Command Center**.

## 🛑 STOP. READ THIS FIRST.

**The "Civilian" Mindset:**
*   "I'll use my old laptop."
*   "WiFi is fine."
*   "8GB RAM is enough."
*   **Result:** Defeat. Frustration. "AI is too hard."

**The "Warlord" Mindset (You):**
*   "I need a weapon, not a toy."
*   "Latency is the enemy."
*   "Memory is intelligence."
*   **Result:** 200% Efficiency. Domination. "This is easy."

## 1. The Engine (Hardware)

Your hardware is the brain of your operation. If the brain is small, the thoughts are slow.

### ✅ The Requirement
| Component | Minimum (Scout) | **Recommended (Warlord)** | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAM (Memory)** | 16 GB | **32 GB - 64 GB+** | **RAM = Context.** AI needs to hold the entire project in its "head". <br>• 16GB = Smart Kid.<br>• 64GB = Genius Architect. |
| **Chip (CPU)** | M1 Pro / i7 | **M3/M4 Max / Ultra** | **Chip = Thinking Speed.** Don't let your General wait for orders. |
| **Storage** | 512 GB | **1 TB NVMe** | Speed. Loading 10,000 files should be instant. |

### 🛒 Shopping List (Vietnam Context)
*   **Best Value:** Mac Studio M2 Max (32GB/64GB RAM).
*   **Best Mobile:** MacBook Pro M3 Pro/Max (36GB RAM).
*   **Budget King:** Mac Mini M2 Pro (32GB RAM).
*   **PC Users:** Any high-end Gaming PC with 64GB DDR5 RAM + NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3060+).

## 2. The Supply Line (Network)

You are downloading intelligence from the cloud. A thin straw (WiFi) won't work. You need a firehose.

### ✅ The Requirement
| Component | Minimum | **Recommended** | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internet** | 100 Mbps | **1 Gbps Fiber (FTTH)** | **Bandwidth = Ammo Supply.** When you deploy, you send massive data. |
| **Connection** | WiFi 6 | **LAN Cable (Cat6/Cat8)** | **Stability.** WiFi flickers. Cables do not. A flicker kills a long AI task. |
| **Route** | Standard | **International Priority** | AI servers are in the US. You need a direct line. |

### 🛠️ Action Steps
1.  **Call your ISP (Viettel/VNPT/FPT):**
    *   Ask for "Gói Doanh Nghiệp" (Business Pack) or "Gói Game".
    *   Prioritize **International Bandwidth** (Băng thông quốc tế).
2.  **Buy a Cable:**
    *   Don't use WiFi for deep work. Plug a **Cat6 or Cat8 Ethernet Cable** directly into your router.
    *   If you use a MacBook, buy a **USB-C to Ethernet Adapter (2.5GbE or 5GbE)**.

## 3. The Tunnel (Antigravity Proxy)

The internet is a jungle of traffic jams. The **Antigravity Proxy** is your private underground tunnel to the AI Brain.

### 🚀 What is it?
It connects your terminal directly to Google/Anthropic servers, bypassing local congestion and saving you **90% on costs** (by routing to efficient models).

### ⚙️ How to Activate
*(Detailed automated setup is in the next phase. For now, understand the concept.)*

1.  **Speed Test:**
    *   Go to [Fast.com](https://fast.com) -> Show more info -> Check **Latency (Unloaded)**.
    *   **Target:** < 150ms to US servers.
    *   **Reality:** Often > 250ms in Vietnam without Proxy/VPN.
2.  **The Solution:**
    *   We will install `antigravity-claude-proxy`.
    *   It acts as a "Turbo Button" for your terminal.

## 4. The Checklist: Ready for Battle?

Do not proceed to Phase 2 (Software Setup) until you check ALL boxes.

### 🖥️ Hardware
- [ ] My RAM is **32GB or higher**. (If 16GB, I accept I will be slower).
- [ ] My Disk has **100GB+ free space**.
- [ ] I have a **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** or a Laptop battery. (Power cuts = Death).

### 🌐 Network
- [ ] I am connected via **LAN Cable** (Not WiFi).
- [ ] My Internet Speed is **> 200 Mbps**.
- [ ] My Latency is stable.

### 🧠 Mindset
- [ ] I understand I am the **Commander**, not the Coder.
- [ ] I will not panic when I see code. I will **read** it like a map.
- [ ] I am ready to achieve **200% Efficiency**.
