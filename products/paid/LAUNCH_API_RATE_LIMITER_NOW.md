```markdown
Stop Building Rate Limiters From Scratch. Secure Your API in 5 Minutes.

Building a robust, distributed rate limiter is hard. You have to handle race conditions, choose the right algorithm, manage Redis connections, and build a UI to manage it all.

THE PROBLEM
You're building an API with FastAPI, Express, or Flask. But suddenly you're:
- Writing complex Redis Lua scripts to avoid race conditions
- Debugging off-by-one errors in sliding window algorithms
- Building admin UIs to manage rate limit rules
- Handling distributed state across multiple servers
- Preventing abuse without blocking legitimate users

Every hour on rate limiting is an hour NOT spent on your core product.

THE SOLUTION
API Rate Limiter Kit is a drop-in, production-ready rate limiting solution. Built with FastAPI (Python) and React, it integrates seamlessly into your existing stack or runs as a standalone microservice.

WHAT YOU GET
✅ Drop-in Middleware: Protect your FastAPI routes instantly
✅ 3 Professional Strategies:
   • Fixed Window: Standard, efficient limiting
   • Sliding Window: Smooth traffic shaping
   • Token Bucket: Perfect for handling bursty traffic
✅ Redis-Backed: Fully distributed, works across multiple server instances
✅ Admin Dashboard:
   • Manage rules visually (no DB hacks)
   • Monitor hit rates in real-time
   • Configure per-endpoint limits
   • User-specific rate limits
✅ Integration Examples: FastAPI + Express.js included
✅ CLI Testing Tool: Simulate traffic and verify limits
✅ Docker Ready: docker-compose up and you're running

WHY $37?
A senior engineer takes ~20 hours to build a production rate limiter with UI.
20 hours x $50/hr = $1,000 value.
Get it today for $37.

WHO IS THIS FOR?
• SaaS Developers protecting expensive API endpoints (AI, payment gateways)
• Platform Engineers preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage
• Indie Hackers who need production-grade rate limiting without the complexity

100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE
If you can't get it running in 15 minutes, I'll refund you immediately.

TECHNICAL SPECS
• Language: Python 3.12+ (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend)
