# API Rate Limiter Kit

**Stop Building Rate Limiters From Scratch. Secure Your API in 5 Minutes.**

Building a robust, distributed rate limiter is hard. You have to handle race conditions, choose the right algorithm, manage Redis connections, and build a UI to manage it all.

The **API Rate Limiter Kit** gives you a production-ready solution out of the box.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

- **Drop-in Middleware**: Protect your FastAPI routes instantly.
- **3 Professional Strategies**:
  - **Fixed Window**: Standard, efficient limiting.
  - **Sliding Window**: Smooth traffic shaping.
  - **Token Bucket**: Perfect for handling bursty traffic.
- **Redis-Backed**: Fully distributed. Works across multiple server instances.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage rules and monitor status visually. No more DB hacks.
- **Docker Compose**: Deploy the entire stack with one command.

## 💡 Why You Need This

- **Save 20+ Hours**: Don't waste time writing Lua scripts and React dashboards.
- **Prevent Abuse**: Stop bots and scrapers from hammering your expensive API endpoints.
- **Fair Usage**: Ensure no single user monopolizes your resources.
- **Tiered Limits**: Easily implement different limits for different endpoints (e.g., stricter limits on `/login`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, Redis-py
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
