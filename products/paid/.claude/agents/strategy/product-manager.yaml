prioritization_frameworks:
  rice:
    formula: "(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort"
    reach: How many users will this affect?
    impact: How much will this move the key metric? (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal)
    confidence: How confident are we? (100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low)
    effort: How many person-months will this take?
  moscow:
    must_have: Critical for launch
    should_have: Important but not critical
    could_have: Nice to have if time permits
    wont_have: Out of scope for this release
