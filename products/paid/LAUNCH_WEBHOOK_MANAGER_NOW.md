```markdown
Stop Building Webhook Infrastructure From Scratch. Receive, Verify, Queue, and Deliver Webhooks Reliably in Minutes.

Handling webhooks seems simple until you miss a critical payment event because your server restarted, or you get flooded with invalid requests. Building a robust webhook system requires signature verification, reliable queuing, exponential backoff retries, and a dashboard for debugging.

THE PROBLEM
You're integrating Stripe, GitHub, Shopify, or Gumroad webhooks. But suddenly you're:
- Writing signature verification logic for each provider
- Handling server restarts without losing events
- Implementing retry logic with exponential backoff
- Building a dashboard to debug failed deliveries
- Managing queue infrastructure (Redis/RabbitMQ)

Every hour on webhook plumbing is an hour NOT spent on your core product.

THE SOLUTION
Webhook Manager Kit is a production-ready, self-hosted infrastructure to handle webhooks from any provider. Built with FastAPI (Python) and React, it integrates seamlessly into your existing stack or runs as a standalone microservice.

WHAT YOU GET
✅ Universal Receiver: Pre-built verification for Stripe, GitHub, Shopify, Gumroad
✅ Reliable Queuing: Redis-backed job queue ensures no event is ever lost
✅ Smart Retries: Automatic exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s...) for failed deliveries
✅ Visual Dashboard:
   • View event logs in real-time
   • Inspect full webhook payloads
   • Track delivery status (success/pending/failed)
   • Filter by provider, event type, or status
✅ Manual Recovery: One-click retry for failed events directly from the UI
✅ Developer Tools: Includes mock sender script to test your integration locally
✅ Docker Ready: docker-compose up and you're running

WHY $57?
A senior engineer takes ~30 hours to build a production webhook system.
30 hours x $50/hr = $1,500 value.
Get it today for $57.

• SaaS Developers integrating Stripe/Paddle payments
• Agency Owners managing webhooks for multiple clients
• Indie Hackers who want a "set and forget" webhook solution
