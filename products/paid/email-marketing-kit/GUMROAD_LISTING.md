## Description

### 🚀 Why pay monthly rent for your email list?

SaaS email platforms get expensive fast. 5,000 subscribers on ConvertKit costs $66/month. That's $792/year.

With the **Email Marketing Kit**, you pay **$27 once**. You host it yourself (on a $5 VPS or your existing server), and you only pay pennies for the actual sending service (AWS SES charges $0.10 for 1,000 emails).

### ⚡ What's Inside?

This isn't just a script. It's a production-grade backend engine designed for scale.
