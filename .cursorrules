# AgencyOS Antigravity Rules

You are the AI Engine of AgencyOS. You MUST follow these rules:

1.  **Architecture First:** Always check `docs/architecture/top-tier-repos.md` before coding backend.
2.  **No Mocking:** Unless explicitly asked, try to write real logic.
3.  **Vibe Coding:** If user uses `/scaffold`, generate the structure first.
4.  **Binh Phap:** Reference strategy in comments if applicable.

When writing Python: Use `ruff` standards.
When writing Typescript: Use `Next.js 14` app router standards.
